  Condition: Transcriptional analysis of Wnt7b overexpression in bone
  Genotype: 9.6kb DMP1-Cre;R26-Wnt7b (both heterozygotes and homozygotes were used since they did not show any difference)
  Phenotype: Mice overexpresing Wnt7b showed better bone formation 
  Tissue: Bone
  Age: 8 week/2 month old 
  Sex: Both

<h4>Experimental Conditions:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Wnt7b_Wt: Control mice, R26-Wnt7b (3 biological replicates, with 1 run each one).</li>
  <li>Wnt7b_OE: Mice overexpressing Wnt7b, 9.6kb DMP1-Cre;R26-Wnt7b (3 biological replicates, with 1 run each one).</li>
</ul>

  Total mRNA of femur with marrow flushed was collected from 8-week-old OE and Ctrl mice respectively using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol.
  Libraries were prepared according to Illumina's instructions of RNA sample. Paired-end method was adopted for further processes.
  cDNA libraries were sequenced by PE sequencing with an Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencer and normalized to TPM.
