<h3>Deletion of Sclerostin gene in an Osteogenesis imperfecta mouse model</h3>
<p>
  <b>Experimental condition:</b> Transcriptional analysis of the effects of deletion of Sclerostin gene in an Osteogenesis imperfecta mouse model.<br>
  <b>Gene:</b> Sost gene codifies Sclerostin, a secreted molecule that binds to LRP5 on the surface of osteoblasts, whereby it interferes with WNT signaling and thus decreases bone formation.<br>
  <b>Phenotype:</b> OI mice lacking of Sost gene showed more bone density and mass that they got older. These mice also showed higher P1NP serum concentrations and lower TRAP5b serum levels than Jrt;Sost-het mice at the age of 8 weeks.<br>
  <b>Tissue:</b> Tibiae.<br>
  <b>Age:</b> 8 week old.<br>
  <b>Sex:</b> Males.<br>
  <b>Layout:</b> Paired.<br>
  <b>Reads length:</b> 100 bp.<br>
  <b>Sample processing:</b> Male mice were euthanized at the age of 8 weeks (n=4 mice per group). Tibia shafts were dissected, the bone marrow was flushed out and the bones were immediately immersed in RNAlater (Thermo Fisher) and stored at − 80 °C until processing. After mincing with scissors, the bones were blotted to remove excess RNAlater and manually grinded using a liquid nitrogen-cooled mini mortar and pestle set, and then transfered to TRIzol. The total RNA was extracted using the phenol–chloroform method. 
  RNA libraries for RNA-seq were prepared using SMARTER mRNA-Seq Library Prep Kit following manufacturer's protocols. mRNA enrichment was performed using the NEBNext Poly(A) Magnetic Isolation Module (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). cDNA synthesis was achieved with the NEBNext Modules (New England Biolabs). The remaining steps of the library preparation were done using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs)and sequencing was performed by PE with an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer and normalised to TPM.
