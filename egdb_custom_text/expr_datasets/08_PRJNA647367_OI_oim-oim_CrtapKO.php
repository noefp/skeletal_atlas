Femora and tibiae were harvested from WT, oim/oim, and CrtapKO mice at 3 months of age, N=4/genotype. Samples were obtained by removing the epiphyses, thoroughly flushing the bone marrow, and scraping off the periosteal membrane; all these procedures were performed on ice. The samples were homogenized in TriPure Isolation Reagent (Roche REF 11667157001) and processed for RNA extraction according to the manufacturer’s instructions until the chloroform separation step. An equal volume of freshly-made, RNase-free 75% ethanol was added to the clear supernatant obtained from the chloroform separation, mixed, and then transferred to an RNeasy Micro column (Qiagen cat# 74004). Digestion with DNase I and elution of RNA was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA samples were tested for quality using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. 
Sequencing libraries were prepared from the RNA samples by use of the TruSeq mRNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina). Then sequencing was performed by SE with an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer and normalised to TPM.
