<h3>Transcriptome of Osteogenesis Imperfecta mice models</h3>
<p>
  <b>Experimental condition:</b> Transcriptional analysis of Crtap ko and oim/oim Osteogenesis Imperfecta models.<br>
  <b>Genes:</b> Crtap is a scaffold protein that holds two other proteins, P3H1 and PPIB, in a heterotrimeric complex involved in post-translational modification of the pro-chains of type I collagen. The oim/oim model presents a null mutation in the COL1A2 gene of type I collagen.<br>
  <b>Phenotype:</b> Both mice models displayed Osteogenesis Imperfecta phenotypes.<br>
  <b>Tissue:</b> Femorae and tibiae.<br>
  <b>Age:</b> 12 week old.<br>
  <b>Sex:</b> Both.<br>
  <b>Layout:</b> Single.<br>
  <b>Reads length:</b> 75 bp.<br>
  <b>Sample processing:</b> RNA was extracted from cortical tibial and femoral bone and libraries were constructed using the SMART-Seq v4 UltraLow RNA Input Kit. Library construction was completed using the ThruPLEX DNA-seq kit.
  cDNA libraries were sequenced by PE sequencing with an Illumina NextSeq 550 sequencer and normalized to TPM.
