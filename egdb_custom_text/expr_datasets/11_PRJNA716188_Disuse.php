  Condition: Effects of disuse in bone by hindlimb unloading for 7 days 
  Procedure: Orthopedic stainless pin was surgically placed in the right femoral midshaft of mice, followed by an inoculation of Staphylococcus aureus into the medullary cavity
  Phenotype: Decrease in bone mass and increase the risk of fracture
  Tissue: Bone
  Age: 11 week/2 month and 3 week old
  Sex: Females

<h4>Experimental Conditions:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Disuse_Control: Control mice, not unloading hindlimbs (8 biological replicates, with 1 run each one).</li>
  <li>Disuse_HLU: Mice with hindlimbs suffering unloading (disuse) (8 biological replicates, with 1 run each one).</li>

</ul>

  After cutting the ends of bones and flushing marrow with PBS, the cortical bone was immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. 
  Subsequently, Trizol was added while the bone is maintained frozen in an eppendorf tube placed in a liquid nitrogen bath, homogenized in the same eppendorf tube with the Fastprep24 machine (MP Biomdicals), and total RNA was isolated and purified using manufacture recommendations for the PureLink RNA kit (Life Technologies). 
  RNA libraries were prepared for sequencing using standard Illumina protocols and samples were sequenced by PE sequencing with an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer and normalized to TPM.
