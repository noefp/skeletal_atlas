  Condition: Transacriptional analysis of the effects of partial ablation of DTA in osteocytes
  Genotype: DTAfl/+;Dmp1-Cre (DTA -/- is lethal before birth) 
  Phenotype: Mice heterozygotes for DTA showed a delay in growth, loss of bone mass, kyphosis and deformities as they get older. Had more empty lacunae without the presence of osteocytes within cortical and trabecular bone matrix and impairment of osteocyte network. These changes were gender insensitive.
  Tissue: Bone
  Age: 4 week/1 month old
  Sex: Both

<h4>Experimental Conditions:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>DTA_Wt: Control mice (2 biological replicates, with 1 run each one).</li>
  <li>DTA_heterozygous: Mice heterozygous from DTA gene, DTAfl/+;Dmp1-Cre (2 biological replicates, with 1 run each one).</li>

<p>
  Total RNA of whole cortical bone with bone marrow flushed out from 4-week WT and DTAhet mice was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher), quantified and purified using Bioanalyzer 2100 and RNA 6000 Nano LabChip Kit (Agilent). 
  Following purification, mRNA library were constructed following the vendorâ€™s recommended protocol and sequencing was performed by PE with an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer and normalised to TPM.
